Home Flask Web application, currently being used to implement a bunch of silly, but fun features :)


To get started, create a virtual environment.
`python3 -m venv venv`

Then, activate the venv: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

Then, install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next, export the flask app .py so flask knows what you want to run: `export FLASK_APP=reminder.py`
On windows: `set FLASK_APP=reminder.py`

Finally, do: `flask run`
